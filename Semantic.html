                <h2> F1 Sport </h2>
                <p>Formula One, commonly abbreviated as F1, is the highest class of international racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The FIA Formula One World Championship
                    has been one of the world's premier forms of motorsport since its inaugural running in 1950. The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules all participants' cars must follow. A Formula One season consists of a series of races,
                    known as Grands Prix. Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and continents on either purpose-built circuits or closed roads. A point-system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships: one for the drivers,
                    and one for the constructors—now synonymous with teams. Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the highest class of racing licence the FIA issues, and the races must be held on Grade One tracks, the highest grade rating the FIA
                    issues for tracks. Formula One cars are the world's fastest regulated road-course racing cars, owing to high cornering speeds achieved by generating large amounts of aerodynamic downforce, much of which is generated by front and rear
                    wings, as well as underbody tunnels. The cars depend on electronics, aerodynamics, suspension, and tyres. Traction control, launch control, and automatic shifting, and other electronic driving aids were first banned in 1994. They were
                    briefly reintroduced in 2001, and have more recently been banned since 2004 and 2008, respectively.[1] With the average annual cost of running a team—designing, building, and maintaining cars, pay, transport—at approximately £220 million,[2]
                    Formula One's financial and political battles are widely reported. The Formula One Group is owned by Liberty Media, which acquired it in 2017 from private-equity firm CVC Capital Partners for US$8 billion.[3][4]

                <h3> F1 teams </h3>
                <p> Formula 1 is a team sport. It needs to be to change all 4 tyres on a car in under 2 seconds! F1 teams design and build their cars and get them ready to race. Each has their own history. Each has their own unique approach. All want to be
                    the fastest. </p>
